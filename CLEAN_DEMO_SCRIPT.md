# V10 Demo Script - Clean Narration Only

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:45)

Hello to everyone who's made the decision to explore the most significant shift in property marketing this year.

I'm about to show you a complete agency workflow that connects photographers, agents, and AI into one seamless ecosystem. The time you invest watching this? You'll win it back in your first listing.

What you're about to witness is real collaboration, real automation, real results. AI can't build client relationships. It can't negotiate. It can't close deals. But it can handle everything else. Let me show you how.

---

## LOGIN & PHOTOGRAPHER PORTAL (0:45 - 3:30)

This is our multi-tenant agency portal. I'm logging in as Savills London. First as a photographer to show you the collaboration workflow.

Organization: Savills. Office: London. Role: Photographer. Anya Rowlings—our property photographer.

Welcome to the Photographer Portal. Anya just finished a shoot for Avenue Road, a beautiful 4-bed property. She needs to get these photos to the agent fast.

Property name: Avenue Road. This creates a folder agents will see instantly.

Now I'm dropping 20 raw photos straight from her camera. No organization. No renaming. Just drag, drop, upload.

Real-time preview grid shows exactly what's uploading. She doesn't need to categorize—the AI will handle that for agents.

Sending these to James Smith, our senior agent. One click: Upload & Notify Agent. James gets instant notification, photos are in his workspace. No email chains. No Dropbox links. No lost files. Pure collaboration.

---

## AGENT VIEW & PHOTO CATEGORIZATION (3:30 - 6:30)

Now I'm James Smith, the agent. Just got Anya's notification.

Photographer Uploads section—there's Avenue Road, uploaded 2 minutes ago, 20 photos ready.

I can preview everything she sent. If I like them: "Use These Photos"—they populate my listing form automatically.

Photos loaded. Now let me enter the postcode first: GU6 8SE.

Watch this—instant location enrichment. Our system just:
- Pulled GPS coordinates from postcodes.io
- Queried OpenStreetMap for nearby amenities
- Analyzed school catchment areas with Ofsted ratings
- Calculated transport links and commute times
- Gathered area demographics

All of this flows into the brochure automatically. Competitors make you research this manually. You're already 15 minutes ahead.

Basic property details: 4 bed, 3 bath, £1.25M, 2,400 sqft, Avenue Road, Cranleigh.

Target audience: Families with Children. The AI will emphasize school ratings, garden space, bedroom sizes.

Tone: Warm & Inviting—homey, personal, family-focused.

Floorplan uploaded—gets its own dedicated page with professional formatting.

Now the magic: AI photo categorization. Anya dropped 20 uncategorized photos. Watch what happens when I click "Analyze Photos with AI."

Computer vision analyzing every image. Identifying room types, assessing quality, scoring marketing effectiveness, detecting staging opportunities, ranking for optimal placement.

Eight seconds. Done. Perfectly organized:
- Cover photo - best exterior, automatically selected
- Kitchen - 2 photos
- Bedrooms - 4 photos assigned to Bedroom 1, 2, 3, 4
- Bathrooms - 3 photos
- Living areas - 3 photos
- Garden - 2 photos
- Exterior - 3 additional angles

See these quality scores? The AI tells you which images will perform best on Rightmove, social media, in print. Data-driven decisions, not guesses.

## GENERATION (6:30 - 8:00)

Form complete. Photos categorized. Location enriched. Hitting generate.

When I click this, here's what happens in parallel:

**Location Enrichment** (if not complete): Schools within 1 mile with Ofsted ratings, transport links, commute times to London, nearby amenities, area demographics.

**Computer Vision**: Every photo analyzed for visible features. Kitchen appliances, bedroom size, bathroom fixtures.

## BROCHURE EDITOR - REAL FEATURES (8:00 - 13:00)

But here's what separates us: **You have complete creative control.**

I'm clicking directly on this headline. Editing it. Live. In-place. Like Microsoft Word, but in a professional brochure layout.

## BUSINESS CASE (17:00 - 18:30)

Let's talk real numbers. This isn't a "nice to have"—it's business transformation.

**Small Independent Agency:**

- 1.5 hours manual work per listing = 15 hours/month
- At £50/hour = £750/month in labor costs
- Platform cost: **£99/month**
- **Net savings: £651/month = £7,812/year**

**Medium Agency (3-5 Agents):**
- 30 listings/month

- At £50/hour = £2,250/month
- Platform cost: **£199/month** (multi-user, unlimited)

This isn't a cost. It's a **10x ROI investment**.

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT (18:30 - 19:30)

Here's what separates us from legacy proptech:

**We never stop improving.**

Every time you edit AI text, the system learns. Every time you prefer one photo over another, it notes patterns. Every feedback trains the model to your style.

**Machine learning that adapts to your agency.**

Savills writes differently than Foxtons. Foxtons writes differently than boutiques. The AI learns your voice, preferences, brand personality.

Over 3 months, the system generates copy needing 80% less editing. Over 6 months, it's writing in your exact style from first draft.

Most software releases updates once a year. We ship improvements **weekly**. Your Monday feedback becomes a Friday feature.

This platform—**Version 10**. We launched Version 1 six months ago. That's our speed.

---

## ECOSYSTEM VISION (19:30 - 20:30)

Let me paint the full picture of where this goes.

The brochure is the **heart**. It pumps data to every organ:

**Today (Production Ready):**

## USPs VS COMPETITORS (20:30 - 21:30)

Let's be direct about competition.

**Traditional Design Agencies:**
- 3-5 day turnaround
- £200-£500 per brochure
- No revisions without fees
- No collaboration tools
- No data enrichment

**Template Platforms (Canva, etc.):**

- No AI intelligence
- No team collaboration
- Static output

**Property Portals (Rightmove, Zoopla):**
- Limited to their platform
- No brochure generation
- No photo analysis
- No location enrichment
- Locked ecosystem

**Us:**
- **12-minute turnaround** from upload to finished brochure
- **Unlimited listings** for one monthly fee
- **Infinite AI variations** until perfect
- **Multi-tenant collaboration** (photographers, agents, admins)
- **Automatic location enrichment** with 7 data categories
- **18 professional templates** with 5 layout options per page
- **6 export formats** + full repurposing ecosystem
- **Continuous learning** - improves with every use
- **You stay in control** - AI assists, you approve

We're not competing with design agencies. We're in a category of one.

## CLOSING (21:30 - 23:00)

Here's where we are.

You just watched a complete agency workflow—photographer upload to agent collaboration to AI generation to professional brochure to multi-channel repurposing—in **12 minutes.**

You've seen:
- Multi-tenant portal with role-based access
- Photographer-agent real-time collaboration
- AI photo categorization with quality scoring
- Automatic location enrichment (schools, transport, amenities)
- GPT-4 copy with 25 anti-jargon rules
- Word-like editing with 7 transformation styles
- 18 professional templates, 5 page layouts
- Photo swapping, drag-drop reordering
- Text formatting toolbar
- Full marketing ecosystem (staging, video, social, email, SEO, print)
- 6 export formats

This isn't a prototype. **Production-ready, today.**

**The Question:**

How many listings do you handle monthly? Multiply by 1.8 hours. That's time lost to manual work a machine does better, faster, cheaper.

What could you do with that time? More viewings? Valuations? Negotiations? Closed deals?

**Pricing:**

Less than your office coffee budget.

- **Starter:** £99/month - 1-2 users, 50 brochures
- **Professional:** £199/month - 10 users, unlimited brochures
- **Enterprise:** £499/month - Unlimited users, white-label, custom integrations

**The Offer:**

**14-day free trial.** Full access. No credit card. Cancel anytime.

If this doesn't save you 10+ hours in month one, you shouldn't pay.

**How to Start:**

Link in description. Sign up takes 2 minutes. Upload one property. See results.

Larger agency? Book custom demo. We'll walk through your workflows, integrate your systems, train your team, set up your branding.

**Final Thought:**

Property in 2025 isn't about who has the best designer. It's about who has the best **technology infrastructure.**

AI isn't replacing agents. But agents **using AI** are absolutely outpacing those who don't.

Early adopters aren't just saving time—they're winning more instructions because they're professional, fast, consistent.

So the question isn't "Should I try this?" It's: **"Can I afford to let my competitors get there first?"**

Thanks for watching. See you in the platform.
