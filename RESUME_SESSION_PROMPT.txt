COPY AND PASTE THIS PROMPT TO CLAUDE TOMORROW

I'm continuing work on the property-listing-generator project. We just completed implementing an AI text transformation chatbot system. Here's what was done:

**Project Location:**
C:\Users\billm\Desktop\Listing agent\property-listing-generator

**What We Built:**
A complete AI-powered text transformation chatbot that allows users to transform brochure text into different styles (bullet points, key features, concise, elaborate, professional, friendly).

**Files Modified:**
1. backend/main.py - Added POST /api/transform-text endpoint (lines 1504-1620)
2. backend/schemas.py - Added transformation schemas (lines 456-486)
3. frontend/brochure_editor_v3.html - Added chatbot UI and modal
4. frontend/brochure_editor_v3.css - Added all styling for chatbot
5. frontend/brochure_editor_chatbot.js - NEW FILE with all functionality
6. test_chatbot.py - Backend testing script
7. CHATBOT_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Complete documentation

**Git Commit:**
Commit c36ec30: "Add AI Text Transformation Chatbot System"
All changes committed and saved.

**Current Issue:**
The chatbot backend is working (API returns transformed text), but the before/after preview modal is not showing up in the browser. The modal should appear after clicking a transformation style button, but it's not visible even though the console shows "Modal should now be visible".

**Debugging Info from Console:**
- Transformations are succeeding (API calls work)
- Console shows: "Showing preview modal with result: [Object]"
- Console shows: "Modal should now be visible"
- BUT the modal doesn't actually appear on screen

**What Needs Fixing:**
1. Debug why the preview modal (#transformPreviewModal) isn't displaying
2. The modal has CSS with z-index 10000 and !important rules
3. May need to check if modal is being rendered correctly in DOM
4. May need to adjust modal positioning or display styles

**How to Test:**
1. Start server: cd "C:\Users\billm\Desktop\Listing agent\property-listing-generator" && python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
2. Open: http://localhost:8000/static/brochure_editor_v3.html
3. Click on any text in the brochure
4. Click purple "AI Transform" button in header
5. Click any transformation style (e.g., "Bullet Points")
6. Check browser console for logs
7. Modal should appear but currently doesn't

**Key Files to Check:**
- frontend/brochure_editor_v3.html (modal HTML at lines 206-252)
- frontend/brochure_editor_chatbot.js (showTransformPreview function)
- frontend/brochure_editor_v3.css (modal CSS at lines 1888-1914)

**Reference Documentation:**
Read CHATBOT_IMPLEMENTATION.md for complete implementation details.

Please help debug why the modal isn't appearing and fix it so users can see the before/after preview when transforming text.
