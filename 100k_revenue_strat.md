## 💰 Financial Projections

### Scenario 1: Pure Pay-As-You-Go (£2 per brochure)

**To Reach £100,000:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target Revenue | £100,000 |
| Price per Brochure | £2.00 |
| Brochures Needed/Year | 50,000 |
| Brochures per Month | 4,167 |

**Customer Acquisition Required:**

| Conversion Rate | Agencies Needed | Agents Needed | Feasibility |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| 100% (all listings) | 278 agencies | 833 agents | Unrealistic |
| 75% (premium listings) | 370 agencies | 1,111 agents | Aggressive |
| 50% (mid-high tier) | 556 agencies | 1,667 agents | **Realistic Target** |
| 25% (premium only) | 1,111 agencies | 3,333 agents | Conservative |

**Calculation:** 4,167 brochures/month ÷ 15 listings per agency ÷ 50% conversion = **556 agencies**

### Scenario 2: Tiered Subscription Model (RECOMMENDED)

**Pricing Tiers:**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Brochures Included | Cost per Brochure | Overage Rate | Target Customer |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Free Trial** | £0 | 5 | N/A | N/A | New users (conversion funnel) |
| **Pay-As-You-Go** | £2/brochure | Per use | £2.00 | N/A | Sporadic users (1-3/month) |
| **Solo Agent** | £10/month | 8 | £1.25 | £1.50 | 1-agent offices |
| **Small Agency** | £25/month | 20 | £1.25 | £1.50 | 2-5 agents |
| **Medium Agency** | £75/month | 75 | £1.00 | £1.25 | 6-15 agents |
| **Enterprise** | £200/month | 250 | £0.80 | £1.00 | 15+ agents, networks |

**Why NOT Unlimited:**
- Protects profit margins from abuse
- Your API cost: £0.04 per brochure
- At 5,000 brochures/month: £200 cost vs £200 revenue = 0% margin ❌
- Capped model ensures 60-95% margins even with heavy usage ✅

**Revenue Mix to £100K:**

| Customer Type | Count | Monthly Sub | PAYG Usage | Revenue/Month | Annual Revenue |
|---------------|-------|-------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Free Trial Users | 50 | £0 | 0 | £0 | £0 |
| PAYG Sporadic | 250 | £0 | 2 × £2 | £1,000 | £12,000 |
| Solo Agent Sub | 150 | £10 | 8 brochures | £1,500 | £18,000 |
| Small Agency Sub | 150 | £25 | 20 brochures | £3,750 | £45,000 |
| Medium Agency Sub | 30 | £75 | 75 brochures | £2,250 | £27,000 |
| Enterprise Sub | 3 | £200 | 250 brochures | £600 | £7,200 |
| Overage Fees | - | - | Variable | £317 | £3,800 |
| **TOTAL** | **583 customers** | | | **£9,417/month** | **£113,000/year** |

**Assumptions:**
- 30% conversion from free trial to paid
- 50% of target customers choose subscriptions (rest PAYG)
- ~1,000 total signups (583 paying + 417 free/churned)

## 🎯 Pricing Strategy Analysis

### Is £2 Too Low?

**Arguments FOR Keeping £2:**

1. **Market Penetration**
   - You're unknown - need rapid adoption
   - £2 is psychologically trivial (less than a coffee)
   - Easy impulse purchase, no approval needed
   - Perfect for word-of-mouth viral growth

2. **Massive Value Gap**
   - Traditional copywriters: £180 (90x more expensive)
   - HAILO: £80/month (40x more for 1 brochure)
   - Your £2 is your primary USP

3. **Volume Economics**
   - 98% profit margin (£1.96 per brochure)
   - At £3: Only £12K more revenue in pure PAYG
   - Would lose 30-40% of customers (price elasticity)
   - Net result: LOWER total revenue

4. **Upsell Strategy**
   - Keep base low, monetize add-ons
   - £2 base + £3 bundle = £5 total (still cheap, 95% margin)

**When to Raise Price:**

**Trigger Points:**
1. 1,000+ active customers (proven product-market fit)
2. >80% trial conversion (demand exceeds supply)
3. Competitor raises prices (market follows)
4. Major feature additions (justified increase)
5. Savills endorsement (premium positioning)

**Suggested Price Evolution:**
- **Now:** £2.00 (market entry)
- **500 customers:** £2.50 (+25%)
- **1,500 customers:** £3.00 (+50%)
- **5,000 customers:** £4.00 (+100%)

**Grandfather Clause:** Early adopters stay at £2 forever (loyalty reward)
