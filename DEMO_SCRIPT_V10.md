# Property Listing Generator V10 - Demo Script
## Complete Walkthrough with Sales Narrative

---

## 🎬 OPENING (0:00 - 0:45)

**[Screen: Desktop, cursor ready to click browser]**

**Script:**
> "Hello to everyone who's made the decision to explore what might be the most significant shift in property marketing you'll see this year.
>
> I'm about to show you something that will fundamentally change how your agency operates. The time you're investing to watch this demo? You'll win it back within your first use—and then some.
>
> What you're about to witness is a full-stack AI solution built for the everyday agent. Not gimmicks, not promises—real automation with human-level accuracy.
>
> Because here's the truth: AI can't win instructions. It can't close deals. It can't build client relationships. **But it can do everything else.** And that's exactly what we've built."

**[Action: Open browser, navigate to localhost:8000]**

---

## 📝 SECTION 1: THE FORM - INTELLIGENT INPUT (0:45 - 3:30)

**[Screen: Form landing page - index.html]**

**Script:**
> "This is where it starts. But this isn't just another form. Watch what happens when I enter a postcode."

**[Action: Type postcode "GU6 8SE" into address field]**

**Script:**
> "See that? **Instant postcode enrichment.** Our system is already pulling location intelligence—schools, transport links, amenities, crime rates, demographic data.
>
> Competitors make you research this manually. You're already 10 minutes ahead.
>
> Now, property details..."

**[Action: Fill in form fields while narrating]**

**Property Type:** House
**Bedrooms:** 4
**Bathrooms:** 3
**Price:** £1,250,000
**Square Footage:** 2,400

**Script:**
> "Notice how the form remembers my Savills branding? It auto-populates my logo, my color scheme, my compliance requirements.
>
> If you're an independent agent, you can customize everything. If you're part of a franchise, your brand guidelines are baked in. **No more off-brand materials.**"

**[Action: Scroll to Target Audience section]**

**Script:**
> "This is critical—and most platforms ignore it completely. **Who is this property FOR?**
>
> Is it a family home? An investment opportunity? A luxury lifestyle purchase?
>
> The AI will tailor every single word based on this. Watch."

**[Action: Select "Families with Children"]**

**[Action: Select Tone: "Warm & Inviting"]**

**Script:**
> "Tone matters. A £300k terrace needs different language than a £3M manor house. Our AI understands this.
>
> Now, the magic part—photos."

---

## 📸 SECTION 2: PHOTO UPLOAD - INTELLIGENT CATEGORIZATION (3:30 - 5:30)

**[Screen: Photo upload section]**

**Script:**
> "Here's where traditional platforms fall apart. They make you manually assign every photo. Kitchen, bedroom, bathroom—one by one. Soul-crushing work.
>
> Watch this."

**[Action: Drag and drop 15-20 property photos at once]**

**Script:**
> "I just dumped 20 photos into the system. No labels. No organization. Just raw photographer files.
>
> And in real-time, our computer vision AI is analyzing every image—identifying room types, assessing quality, scoring composition, detecting staging opportunities."

**[Action: Watch as photos auto-categorize into Cover, Exterior, Kitchen, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Living Areas, Garden]**

**Script:**
> "**Automatic categorization.** Every photo, perfectly organized. Took 8 seconds.
>
> How long does this take you manually? 10 minutes? 15?
>
> And here's what's powerful—see this score? **Photo quality rating.** Our AI is telling you which images will perform best on Rightmove, Zoopla, social media.
>
> You're not guessing anymore. You're operating with data."

**[Action: Scroll to show Smart Photo Suggestions feature]**

**Script:**
> "If you're missing critical shots—hero exterior, main bedroom, kitchen—the system alerts you. **Before** you waste time generating a brochure.
>
> Oh, and one more thing..."

**[Action: Show mobile upload mention/button]**

**Script:**
> "Agents in the field can upload directly from their mobile. Photographer sends you a Dropbox link? Forward it straight into the portal. Someone in the office can then produce the materials while you're still at the property winning the next instruction.
>
> **Cross-team collaboration.** Real-time. No email chains. No lost files."

**[Action: Upload floorplan]**

**Script:**
> "Floorplans get their own dedicated page in the brochure. Professional, clean, automatic."

## 🧠 SECTION 3: GENERATION - THE AI AT WORK (5:30 - 7:00)

**[Screen: Ready to generate, finger hovering over button]**

**Script:**
> "Here's where 60 minutes of manual work becomes 30 seconds of AI work.
>
> When I click this button, here's what happens behind the scenes:
>
> 1. **Location enrichment** pulls live data on schools, transport, local area
> 2. **Computer vision** analyzes every photo for composition, lighting, features
> 3. **GPT-4** writes property copy with 25 critical writing rules we've programmed
> 4. **Compliance checker** ensures every word meets RICS, TPO, Property Ombudsman standards
> 5. **Layout engine** designs a professional brochure in your brand style
>
> All in parallel. All in under a minute."

**[Action: Click "Generate Brochure"]**

**[Screen: Progress tracker animating through stages]**

**Script:**
> "Watch the progress tracker. You can see exactly what's happening:
> - Analyzing photos... ✓
> - Enriching location data... ✓

> - Creating room descriptions... ✓
> - Building compliance checks... ✓
> - Assembling brochure layout... ✓

## ✏️ SECTION 4: BROCHURE EDITOR - WORD-LIKE CONTROL (7:00 - 10:30)

**[Action: Click headline text, start typing]**

**Script:**
> "I'm editing it. Live. In-place. Like Microsoft Word.

> - **Family-Friendly** - Warm, homey, practical

**[Action: Select "Luxury Style" transformation]**

**Script:**
> "**Three seconds.** The entire paragraph rewrites itself while maintaining all the factual details.
>
> Competitors give you one AI output and say 'take it or leave it.' We give you **infinite variations** until it's perfect."

**[Action: Click through pages - Cover, Gallery, Bedrooms, Location, Floorplan]**

**Script:**
> "Every page is editable. Photos can be reordered with drag-and-drop. Text can be modified. Layout stays professional automatically.
>
> Look at this location page—see all this enrichment data? **This was automatic.**
>
> - Nearest schools with Ofsted ratings
> - Train stations with commute times to London
> - Local amenities within walking distance
> - Area demographics and statistics
>
> You didn't research any of this. The AI did it while you were uploading photos."

>
> So the question isn't 'Should I try this?' The question is 'Can I afford not to?'
>
> Thanks for watching. See you on the platform."
