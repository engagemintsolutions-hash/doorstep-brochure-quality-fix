## Design Philosophy

British buyers want:
1. **Clarity** - Price, bedrooms, location upfront
2. **Trust** - Professional, not flashy
3. **Gardens** - Always show the garden!
4. **Warmth** - Cosy, inviting colours
5. **Honesty** - EPC, tenure, chain status visible

*"You can't sell a house with cold corporate colours, love.
People want to imagine having a cuppa in that kitchen."*
